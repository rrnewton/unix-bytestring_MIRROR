* Combine the test suite into a single executable and then do:
    $> darcs setpref test "runhaskell Tests.hs"

* Also, tell Setup.hs so that `cabal test` and `runhaskell Setup.hs
  test` call the test suite.

* Try getting things to compile under Hugs, JHC, and UHC.

* Make the package public and get feedback to solidify the API.

* Try to get the newest/final version of this package folded into "unix".

* BUG: unix-2.5.1.0==ghc-7.4.1 stole the System.Posix.IO.ByteString module name
